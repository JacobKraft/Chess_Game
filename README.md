# Chess Game
Currently allows the user to play versus one player on the same board. The application uses serperate classes for user interaction and the graphics of the game and
the actual chess engine, where valid moves are generated and the rules of chess are upheld. (Planning to add a play computer option using statespace game AI)
## Functions:
  - Highlights all valid moves when a piece is selected
  - Does not let the user move into checkamte
  - Piece moves are animated
## Learned:
  - Object oriented game design (separating engine and display)
  - How to use pygame library to display a game board with animations
